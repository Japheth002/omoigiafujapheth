            Sometimes, things don't go through as expected because somethings happen in between, causing these occurences to flop,
            but consistency should be made available at the time to truly push forward and engage the depth of the scenario. I've learnt
            to understand nature and deal with it whichever way it happens. Even when people don't tend to understand and might even take
            it for sluggishness or being vulnerable to the things or factors that are ultimately surrounding, it is majorly discarded as false.
            The true sounds of nature would make an attraction.

            Learning to be careful with words is vital, because it can be misunderstood when uttered.
            Nature gives us chance to forgive ourselves, and we take it for granted sometimes, but at the end of the day, it's calm and
            tender. Slowly, we think life is slipping away, because we think our actions get the best of us, so we just try to be cautious
            to avoid mistakes, that may still occur again. But we can find joy in the littlest things; even from songs, as they can tend
            to be relatable which ultimately makes us wear a smile.

            Just as lillies reflect the beauty of it's surroundings, a calm mind reflects the beauty of life. Nature's serenity is a reminder
            that life's chaos can be silenced by the stillness within. In the stillness of nature, we find the peace that whispers truths 
            to our soul. In nature's peaceful embrace, we find the solace that remimds us to breathe deeply, letting life's tranquility
            fill our souls. Remember, tranquility is a journey and it's okay to take it one step at a time. Words are like eggs, 
            when any word has been uttered,
             it'll shatter on the ground and scatter into pieces, and these pieces
            cannot be put back together. Sometimes, bottling up emotions wouldn't help, it's better to let 'em go.

            Solace, can be in the form of music. Music heals and patches up broken things, it can tend to be relatable in ways that might not
            even be expressible, music can help in a variety of things like; reducing stress, improving mood, it can help improve cognitive
            performance. Research suggests that music can lower stress and anxiety, be a positive distraction, during tough times, and to do 
            more to improve mental health. Scientifically, music can boost the brain's production of the hormone dopamine. Frequent listening
            to music and adjusting to nature's conditions can tend to be very useful and vital.
